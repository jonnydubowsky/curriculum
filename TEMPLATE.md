## Understanding the Internet through Herbivore

## Authors
Herbivore is made and maintained by Surya Mattu and Jen Kagan. Ingrid Burrington, Eve Weinber and Pedro Galvao Cesar De Oliveira have also contributed to the project. Herbivore was made with the support of NYU's Interactive Telecommunications Program and their Something-In-Residence fellowship. Curriculum written by Lauren Gardner.

## Essential Question
- What information is my computer sharing about me or my online activity?

## Introduction
We will user [Herbivore](https://github.com/samatt/herbivore), an open source tool that aims to demistify the world of network packets for the uninitiated. Herbivore is a free, open source tool that shows users the data packets that travel between their computers and the internet. By surfacing this information, we hope to demystify how the internet works and make network literacy accessible to a much wider audience.
A handful of packet sniffing libraries and desktop applications already exist for analyzing network packets, but were designed for people who have programming experience or a network engineering background; they were not designed as educational tools for people without technical backgrounds. 
In this workshop we will go through the basics of what packet sniffing means and let you try it out yourself.

### Target Audience / Prerequisite & Pre-Assessment
This workshop is intended for adults, young and old. This workshop is ideal for those who are interested in learning how to packet sniff or learn what that even means. 

### Pacing / Duration

- Break down of the class schedule example: 
  - :15 Overview, context, examples and vocabulary 
  - :20 Instruction & hands on exercise 
  - :15 Wrap-up discussion & sharing, reflection or journal and next steps

### Materials
You will need a Mac to run Herbivore :( . But all is not lost! Even if you dont have a Mac you can still learn a whole bunch. We encourage participants to work together and share computers.

## Outcomes & Goals
This section has three parts

#### 1) Provide an overview paragraph that describes briefly the technical concepts and skills covered in the unit;
e.g. "In this three-hour workshop, students will learn about and apply design thinking in the speculative design scenario, then translate their solutions into an interactive 2D single scene game format built in Unity. It includes an introduction to Unity and hands-on coding in Javascript."
* Learn the difference of what is passed in http vs https and what tools you can use to protect your data.

#### 2) Vocabulary
* Packets or Network Packet: A network packet is a formatted unit of data carried by a packet-switched network. A packet consists of control information and user data, which is also known as the payload. Control information provides data for delivering the payload, for example: source and destination network addresses, error detection codes, and sequencing information. Typically, control information is found in packet headers and trailers. 
* Packet Sniffer: A packet inspection tool is software running on a computer that allows you to look at all the network traffic that is being sent and received on the network you are currently connected to. The range of activity this lets you monitor includes your browser traffic, your operating system sending bug reports, services like Dropbox and Spotify talking to their servers and content streaming to devices such as Apple Tvs and Sonos speakers, and your internet of things devices talking on the internet.
* Addresses: The routing of network packets requires two network addresses, the source address of the sending host, and the destination address of the receiving host.
* Payload: In general, payload is the data that is carried on behalf of an application. It is usually of variable length, up to a maximum that is set by the network protocol and sometimes the equipment on the route. When necessary, some networks can break a larger packet into smaller packets.
      
#### 3) Prerequisites & Pre-Assessment 
Any coding languages they should already be comfortable with, any frameworks or tools they should have installed before class or any readings and exercises they should complete before class.

## Exercise Descriptions
Descriptions of each exercise or phase of class. These should be able to be broken out to be taught independently for a shorter class setting or all together for an after school program.

## Student Reflections, Takeaways & Next Steps
- Additional materials for the students to leave with that can help them dig deeper into the subject or additional exercises and challenges to help students progress their knowledge to the next leve and gain mastery of the subject through independent study.
- [Packet Sniffing in Python](http://nifty.stanford.edu/2015/matthews-raymond-packet-sniffing/)
- Open Frameworks based visualization tool showing [Images of the Network](https://github.com/HalfdanJ/ImagesOfTheNetwork)
- Presentation: how might students share their work? With peers, outside world? What media or platforms could/should be referenced to students to encourage sharing (instagram, tumblr...)? 
- Reflection: reflection questions that ask students to think about CS concepts and practices. How can students express what theyâ€™ve learned in some creative way?

## Post Session, Implementation Guidance &  Teaching Reflection
e.g. Please provide some guidance based on experience delivering the unit and potential modifications might you are considering making for future iterations of this unit. This is an opportunity for you as the unit author to give teachers practical guidance.
